CODE OF CONDUCT
Group 5 - Software Engineering Methods

We, as a group, shall always strive to create a positive working environment for all group members. We can do this by:
1. Using inclusive language to ensure that all members of the ground are treated well and have a chance to offer their opinion.
2. Focus on making sure that we all complete our work in a timely manner so as to allow other members of the group to work on their own.
3. Both offering and taking in criticism when needed, and asking for advice when stuck so as to avoid unnecessary delays in work.
4. Showing care towards the opinions of the other members of the group, and working to be respectful of their opinion even when disagreements arises.

We shall also avoid creating a hostile work environment. This can be done by ensuring that we do not do any of the following:
1. Using or exposing other members of the group to unneeded sexism, racism, or other bigotry.
2. Harassing other members of the group needlessly, particularly about the quality of work they produce.
3. Insulting or otherwise making another member of the group feel unvalued and unappreciated.
4. Dismissing another group member's work.
